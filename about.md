  <h1>Hello world, it's Danny</h1>

  <!-- <p>
    I've spent a great portion of my life looking for a craft that would allow me to consistently create experiences for others to enjoy.
    This search led me to explore many different possibilities; I spent a good chunk of time looking to contribute to the world through the power of science,
    vying to become an environmental scientist that would analyze the air, water and soil, as well as come up with sustainable
    solutions with alternative energy.
  </p>

  <p>
     Along with that, I was also able to dive into the art of DJing. I started off by playing out at small events like house parties
     and public venues, which eventually opened up opportunies for me to perform at corporate events and weddings. At certain
     points in my life, I had entertained the idea of becoming a professional gamer, a photographer, a film-maker, a dancer, a chef, the list
     goes on!
  </p> -->

  <p>
    It wasn't until I had a life changing conversation with a very inspiring developer, that I realized I could combine all of my passions
    into a single, focused stream. Designing and developing websites would still allow me to scratch the itch having to artistically
    create content, and at the same time be able to incoporate the fields of my previous professions. I quickly set out to
    gain a foundational skill-set in web development and less than a year later, I am proud to say that I am a Full Stack Web Developer,
    ready to take on the world!
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I am working on this portfolio site while sprinkling in some Javascript here and there, with the ultimate goal of picking up React. I applaud you if you've made it this far, hit me up if you'd like get some coffee or just
    chat about anything, don't hesitate to get in touch!
