  <h1>Hello world, it's Danny</h1>

  <p>
    It wasn't until I had a life changing conversation with an inspiring and passionate developer, that I realized I could combine all of my favorite past times
    into a single, focused stream. Designing and developing websites would still allow me to scratch the itch having to artistically
    create content, and at the same time be able to "get into the zone" while hacking my way through a web application.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since then, I've had the pleasure and privilege of meeting many senior developers and designers from different walks of life, only to discover that there is so much more to learn!
  </p>

  <p>
    These days you'll find me trying to learn some constructional drawing using the DrawABox method (r/artfundementals), while teaching myself React through Udemy, as well as strengthening my foundation by parsing "You Don't Know JS" by Kyle Simpson. I'm always happy to meet like-minded people, so if you'd like to have coffee, lunch, dinner, or just a talk, hit me up!
  </p>
