  <h1>Hello world, it's Danny</h1>

  <!-- <p>
    I've spent a great portion of my life looking for a craft that would allow me to consistently create experiences for others to enjoy.
    This search led me to explore many different possibilities; I spent a good chunk of time looking to contribute to the world through the power of science,
    vying to become an environmental scientist that would analyze the air, water and soil, as well as come up with sustainable
    solutions with alternative energy.
  </p>

  <p>
     Along with that, I was also able to dive into the art of DJing. I started off by playing out at small events like house parties
     and public venues, which eventually opened up opportunies for me to perform at corporate events and weddings. At certain
     points in my life, I had entertained the idea of becoming a professional gamer, a photographer, a film-maker, a dancer, a chef, the list
     goes on!
  </p> -->

  <p>
    It wasn't until I had a life changing conversation with an inspiring and passionate developer, that I realized I could combine all of my favorite past times
    into a single, focused stream. Designing and developing websites would still allow me to scratch the itch having to artistically
    create content, and at the same time be able to "get into the zone" while hacking my way through a web application.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since then, I've had the pleasure and privilege of meeting many senior developers and designers from different walks of life, only to discover that there is so much more to learn!
  </p>

  <p>
    These days you'll find me trying to learn some constructional drawing using the DrawABox method (r/artfundementals), while teaching myself React through Udemy, as well as strengthening my foundation by parsing "You Don't Know JS" by Kyle Simpson. I'm always happy to meet like-minded people, so if you'd like to have coffee, lunch, dinner, or just a talk, hit me up!
